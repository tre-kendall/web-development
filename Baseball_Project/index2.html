          <u><strong>Rules of the Road</strong></u>
        </p>
        <p id="IntroP">
          Baseball, just as any other sport or activity, has plenty of rules to abide by. Without rules and regulation, any sport would be chaotic and unentertaining to follow, so having a basis to go by definitely helps. With balls getting hurled at your head at close to 100mph, it's good to be protected by the laws of the sport! I'll be trying my best to break up the basics of this sport into a general list of rules/objectives.

            Objective of the Offense:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            In baseball, the offense is the side of the game that includes hitting, baserunning, and most importantly: scoring! Starting with an "at bat", each player approaches the plate one at a time to face off against the pitcher. As the pitcher throws the ball to the batter, a pitch must be thrown withing the <b>strike zone</b> to be called a strike by the umpire. If the pitcher throws 3 strikes to the batter, he'll be called out. Balls not thrown within the strike zone are called <b>balls</b>. If the pitcher fails to throw the ball within the strike zone 4 times in an at bat, the batter will reach the base despite not hitting the ball. When on the basepath, the player must touch all 4 bases (first, second, third, and home) to score a run for their team. Chaining hits together as a team is the easiest way to earn runs. Whoever scores the most runs in a game will win. For more about the strategy behind the offense, go to the  <a href="index3.html">Offense</a> tab.

            <br>Objective of the Defense:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            As one might expect from any sport, the defense's job is to prevent the offense from scoring points! A defense in baseball consists of 9 players on the field, each positioned in a strategic place to prevent a batter from getting a hit. Each play starts with a pitch to the batter. The objective for the pitcher specifically is to prevent batters from reaching the base. This can be done by striking out a batter with 3 strikes. If the ball is actually hit by the batter, the defense must play accordingly. If the ball is hit in the air and is caught before touching the ground, the batter is automatically out. If the ball is hit on the ground, a fielder must field the ball and throw it to the base the runner is running to. Touching the bag before the runner reaches it will result in an out, but tagging the runner while they are not on a bag results in the same outcome. After 3 outs, the defense then switches to offense. For more about the strategy behind the offense, go to the  <a href="index4.html">Defense</a> tab.

            <br>Umpires:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Umpires control the game with their game calling. Strikes, balls, and any play between, and umpire's job is to call it correctly. At the Major League level, each of the 4 bases has an umpire. With good eyesight and a keep sense of hearing, an umpire sometimes is forced to call a decision on a play that happened in a fraction of a second. It's impossible to expect an umpire to be correct 100% of the time, but it's also important for the umpire to be consistent with their game-calling. As the official of the game, an umpire also has the power to eject players or coaches for arguing calls/being generally rude. Umpires are one of the most important aspects to the sport of baseball, as one bad call can result in a game turning tides to benefit one team.
