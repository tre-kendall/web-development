          All nine players are used in the act of defensive ability. Like offense, knowing where to put each player in order for them to benifit the team the most is crucial. From infielders having quick thinking to outfielders being quick on their feet, each player depends on another to get all 3 outs in an inning. With this page I aim to break up each position on the field, as well as what strengths they're expected to have.

            Pitcher
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The pitcher initiates each and every play on the baseball field. Tricking the batter with a variety of moving pitches, the pitcher tries to make sure no batters get on base. If a batter DOES reach base, the pitcher is responsible for making sure they do not steal any bases. By keeping an eye on them, and occasinally throwing the ball back to the base they're on, the pitcher is truly the center of a defense.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            Catching every pitch from the pitcher, a catcher's endurance is expected to be high. With leadership qualities and a loud voice, the catcher often is the captain of the team. With such responsibility, the catcher leads with encouraging words and a strong arm to throw runners out if they dare to steal a base. The catcher is also in charge of telling the pitcher what type of pitches to throw, and where to throw them. Paying attention to each batter and what they're capable of is very important when it comes to the second half of the game.

            <br>First Base
          </dt>
          <dd>
            A first basemen is typically fairly tall and lumber, as they're on the receiving end of most plays. Because every runner must run to first after they hit the ball, first basemen are in charge of catching the balls that are fielded by other infielders (or even themselves). Also, as many quick runners try to steal second base, the first basemen must keep the runner on his toes and call out if the runner attempts to steal a base.

            <br>Second Base/Shortstop
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Known as the middle infielders, these players play on both sides of second base. These players are required to have strong communication between each other in the off-chance they must turn a double play. Usually these two players have a strong chemistry so they can read each other without much speaking. Quick hands are often a seeked quality as well, as it helps in throwing runners out at first and helps turn double plays more efficiently.

            <br>Third Base
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Known as the "hot corner", third base is a busy spot as most right handed batters pull the ball. A third basemen must have quick reflexes to field a speedy grounder, and an equally strong arm to throw them out from all the way across the infield. Though not always known for their speed, they are usually bigger players who are willing to put their bodies on the line to stop a fast traveling ball from reaching the outfield.

            <br>Left/Right/Center Field
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Moving out of the infield and into the outfield, outfielders specialize in line drive and pop up plays. If a batter truly connects with a pitch and sends it flying far/high in the air, an outfielder's job is to track the ball down and catch it before it touches the ground. Each of these 3 positions are typically expected to be fast so they can cover lots of ground, as well as having strong arms to throw the ball back into the infield to stop runners from advancing any further than they should.
