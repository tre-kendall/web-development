          <u><strong>Welcome to the World of Baseball!</strong></u>

        <p id="IntroP">
          Invented all the way back in 1839, the sport of baseball was around before the American Civil War! Often referred to as "America's National Pastime", baseball has resonated with the American people for generations. As the country evolved, baseball wasn't far behind. When originally first introduced, players didn't wear gloves or helmets to aid performance, so getting hit with the baseball/hurting yourself to make a play was much more common. Baseball is a sport that demands understanding in order to be interesting, as it's typically categorized as one of the slower sports. Through this website I hope to teach the general audience about what makes this game so fascinating to the American people, as well as the strategy and fundamentals a player goes through in order to reach the rank of a Major League Baseball player. After all, there's a reason they're paid so well!
