          <u><strong>Batting Order: Important?</strong></u>
        </p>
        <p id="IntroP">
          The offensive side to baseball revolves around how efficiently the team can chain hits together to score runs. Putting each of the 9 players in the right order can be the difference between a shutout or a hit-fest. Having said this, allowing these players to play to their strengths and improve the team using unique skills makes a batting lineup one of the most important strategies in the sport. The pitcher will pitch to each player differently, so knowing where to play each person on the team is absolutely crucial. In this page of the website I will be breaking up the role of each player in a batting lineup and how they benifit the team on their journey to victory.

            #1: Leadoff
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The leadoff batter typically specializes in getting on base. While they might not have the best batting average, finding any possible way to get on base, and then score, is what most teams look for. Setting the stage for the later batters to drive them in is all a part of the strategy. Batting is only half the battle though, as the leadoff also is typically speedy on the basepath. Stealing bases, scoring runs, and creating chaos for the other team is an everyday task.

            <br>#2: Contact Hitter
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The second hitter's primary goal is to advance the leadoff batter on the basepath. Just like the leadoff, the second batter usually has a very respectable on-base-percentage, but not as high as the leadoff. Being able to bunt and not hit into double plays also is looked for.

            <br>#3, #4, #5: RBI-Men
          </dt>
          <dd>
            These batters are known as the "heart" of the lineup. Well known for their power and ability to consistently put the ball in play, these players are put in charge of hitting in the #1 and #2 hitters. Typically bigger players, speed is not an expected trait from this bundle of hitters. The end of these batters also marks the end of the first half of the lineup. Although each batter is expected to be adequate enough to secure a spot in the lineup, the batters after the "heart" are not usually as good as the first half.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            These batters produce average numbers offensively, but are usually in the lineup for their defensive performances. These batters usually do not have as high on-base/average percentages as the beginnning of the lineup, but still serve an important role of keeping the inning alive.

            <br>#9: Second Leadoff
          </dt>
          <dd>
            In today's day and age, the #9 batter's role has evolved into one of a secondary leadoff. Although not interchangeable, the #9 hitter can serve the same purpose. It can be looked at as a "not-as-good-leadoff", but they still are to be feared in the batters box and on the base path.
